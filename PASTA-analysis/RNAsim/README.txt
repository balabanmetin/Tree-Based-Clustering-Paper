The true and estimated alignments can be found under Data/ 
The two files config_centroid_nleaves.txt and config_mincluster_nleaves.txt are the configuration files generated by PASTA. They are included here for reproducibility of the results.
To run PASTA with the provided config files:

bash runjob.sh <CONFIG_FILE> <INPUT_FILE> <TEMP_DIR>

Each subdirectory contains
	- unaligned.fasta : unaligned sequences
	- true.fasta: true alignment
	- pasta_centroid_nleaves.marker001.unaligned.aln.gz : PASTA alignment with centroid decomposition
	- pasta_mincluster_nleaves.marker001.unaligned.aln.gz : PASTA alignment with minimum clustering decomposition
