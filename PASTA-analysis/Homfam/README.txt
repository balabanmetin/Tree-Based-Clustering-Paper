The true and estimated alignments can be found under Data/ 
The two files pastaDefault_temp_pasta_config.txt and pastaMinCluster_temp_pasta_config.txt are the configuration files generated by PASTA. They are included here for reproducibility of the results.
To run PASTA with the provided config files:

python run_pasta.py < CONFIG_FILE >

Each subdirectory contains
	- initial.fas : unaligned sequences
	- true.reduced.fas: true alignment
	- pastaDefault.marker001.initial.aln : PASTA alignment with centroid decomposition
	- pastaMinCluster.marker001.initial.aln.gz : PASTA alignment with minimum clustering decomposition
	- pastaDefault_temp_iteration_initialsearch_tree.tre.gz : the tree generated in the initial iteration of centroid decomposition; 
			this tree was used as the starting tree for minimum clustering to control for the effect of initialization on alignment accuracy
